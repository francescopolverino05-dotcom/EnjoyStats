"""Pydantic schemas for football player statistics.

The collection layer splits every player-match row into the three pillars used
by Opta, Wyscout, and StatsBomb-derived pipelines:

* :class:`OffensiveStats` — finishing and chance creation, stored flat so the
  most queried shooting columns can be indexed without JSON unpacking.
* :class:`DefensiveStats` — nested duel, block, foul, interception, and zonal
  recovery structures.
* :class:`DistributionStats` — nested success/total ratios for passing, crosses,
  cutbacks, progressive distribution, and pass locations.

All counts are non-negative integers. Ratio helpers are derived
:attr:`computed_field` values and are never persisted independently of the
underlying success/total pair.
